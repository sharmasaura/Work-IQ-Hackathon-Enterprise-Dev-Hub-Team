# Microsoft Work IQ Hackathon

Everything a team needs to take on a **Work IQ** hackathon challenge — the challenge
pack, a setup guide, an architecture guide, starter code, and a **local simulator** so
you can build and test **without a Microsoft 365 tenant**.

> **Work IQ** grounds answers in your *live work context* — email, meetings, chats,
> files, people, calendar and Copilot memory — reached over **MCP** and **A2A**.

| `challenge-pack/WorkIQ-Hackathon-Challenge-Pack_14-JUN-2026.pdf` | The 6 challenges, judging criteria, capability tiers. **Read first.** |
| `challenge-pack/WorkIQ-Hackathon-Participant-Setup-Guide_14-JUN-2026.pdf` | Step-by-step environment setup (real tenant **and** local simulator). |

## Pick your path

| | Path A — Local simulator | Path B — Real Work IQ |
|---|---|---|
| **Needs a tenant?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (M365 + Copilot, admin consent) |
| **Best for** | Building & testing logic fast, offline | The final, production-grade demo |
| **Setup** | 3 commands (below) | Follow the **Setup Guide PDF** |

You can build your whole solution against **Path A**, then swap the MCP endpoint to the
real server for **Path B** — your agent code doesn't change.

---

## Quick start — Path A (local simulator)

**Prerequisite:** Python 3.10+ on your PATH.

From the repo root (`workiq-hackathon/`):

```powershell
# 1. Create an isolated environment
python -m venv .venv

# 2. Install the simulator's only dependency (mcp)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r simulator\requirements.txt

# 3. Confirm everything works (each prints "ALL ... PASSED")
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe simulator\tests\smoke.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe simulator\tests\mcp_e2e.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe simulator\tests\a2a_e2e.py
```

> macOS / Linux: use `python3 -m venv .venv` then `.venv/bin/python` instead of
> `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

### Ask the simulator a question

```powershell
# Default challenge (c2-contoso), default persona
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe simulator\demo.py --ask "What is blocking qualification?"

# Try the RBAC governance demo — same question, different persona = redacted answer
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe simulator\demo.py --persona contractor --ask "Give me the 45621-B handover brief."
```

### Validate any of the 6 challenge scenarios

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe simulator\tests\validate_scenario.py scenarios\c1-northbridge
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe simulator\tests\validate_scenario.py scenarios\c2-contoso
# ... c3-meridian, c4-arundel, c5-westbrook, c6-edkh
```

### Plug it into your agent (MCP)

Register the simulator like the real Work IQ MCP server — same tool name
(`ask_work_iq`), so your agent code is unchanged. See
[`simulator/README.md`](simulator/README.md) for the full MCP + A2A config and wire
contracts.

---

## Build your agent — Microsoft Agent Framework + a Foundry model

This is the **recommended way to build your hackathon agent**: a reasoning LLM hosted in
**Azure AI Foundry** drives the conversation, and the **Work IQ simulator is wired in as an
MCP tool** via the **Microsoft Agent Framework**. The model decides when to call
`ask_work_iq` (and the Tools actions `fetch` / `create_entity` / `update_entity`), reads the
cited result, and composes the final answer — exercising all four capability tiers,
including the Tools-write tier.

> This works identically against the real Work IQ MCP server later — you only swap the
> `command`/`args` of the MCP tool. Your agent code doesn't change.

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.10+** and the simulator quick start above completed (so `simulator/server.py` runs).
- An **Azure AI Foundry** project with a **chat model deployed** (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`).
- Signed in for Entra auth: `az login`.

### Install

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install agent-framework agent-framework-foundry azure-identity python-dotenv
```

### Configure (env vars read by `FoundryChatClient`)

```powershell
$env:FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-foundry-project>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
$env:FOUNDRY_MODEL            = "gpt-4o-mini"   # your deployment name
```

### Minimal agent (`agent.py`)

```python
import asyncio, sys
from agent_framework import Agent, MCPStdioTool
from agent_framework_foundry import FoundryChatClient
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential

SIM_SERVER = r"simulator\server.py"   # the Work IQ simulator MCP server

async def main():
    workiq = MCPStdioTool(
        name="workiq",
        description="Microsoft Work IQ — ask_work_iq + fetch/create_entity/update_entity over your work context.",
        command=sys.executable,            # the same Python running this agent
        args=[SIM_SERVER],
        env={"WORKIQ_SIM_SCENARIO": "scenarios/c2-contoso",
             "WORKIQ_SIM_PERSONA":  "new_pm"},   # persona drives the RBAC/governance demo
    )

    async with Agent(
        client=FoundryChatClient(credential=AzureCliCredential()),  # reads FOUNDRY_* env vars
        name="WorkIQHackAgent",
        instructions=(
            "You are a workplace assistant. Use the Work IQ tools to answer from the user's "
            "live work context. Always surface the citations the tool returns. When the task "
            "calls for an action (e.g. logging a milestone or updating a status), call the "
            "appropriate Tools action and confirm the write."
        ),
        tools=workiq,
    ) as agent:
        reply = await agent.run("What is blocking qualification, and who owns the test plan?")
        print(reply.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Run it from the repo root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe agent.py
```

### Notes

- **Foundry vs Azure OpenAI** — to use a model via Azure OpenAI instead of a Foundry project,
  swap the client for `from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient` and set
  `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` + `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL` (keep `MCPStdioTool` unchanged).
- **Switch to the real Work IQ** — replace the tool's `command`/`args` with the real MCP
  launch (`npx -y @microsoft/workiq@preview mcp start`); everything else stays the same.
- **A2A instead of MCP** — if your agent reaches Work IQ as a peer agent, run
  `simulator/a2a_server.py` and point an A2A client at `http://127.0.0.1:8920/a2a/` (see
  [`simulator/README.md`](simulator/README.md)).
- **Persona = identity** — change `WORKIQ_SIM_PERSONA` to demo RBAC: an under-privileged
  persona gets the restricted source withheld with a governance note while the rest of the
  synthesis still returns.

## Quick start — Path B (real Work IQ)

Open **`challenge-pack/WorkIQ-Hackathon-Participant-Setup-Guide_14-JUN-2026.pdf`** and
follow it end to end: tenant prerequisites, admin consent for `WorkIQAgent.Ask`, the
service principal, Copilot licensing, and registering the real MCP endpoint. The
`starter-kit/` scripts get you to a first call quickly.

---

## Starter kit

Drop-in helpers in `starter-kit/` (rename / repath as needed):

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `workiq-agent_14-JUN-2026.mjs` | Minimal agent that calls Work IQ over MCP. |
| `workiq-ask-harness_14-JUN-2026.mjs` | Fire a single question and print the cited answer. |
| `workiq-mcp-smoke_14-JUN-2026.mjs` | Confirm your MCP connection + tool list. |
| `workiq-smoke-test_14-JUN-2026.ps1` | PowerShell smoke test. |
